#  K-OS (aka Sneaky Cat) and D-Struction (aka Friendly Cat)

Sneaky Cat (aka K-OS) and his brother Friendly (aka D-Struction) were young, stray / feral / dumped kittens who turned up one day on my door step, starving hungry, skeletally thin, and cold in mid-2022.

Even though Sneaky Cat (aka K-OS) was very skittish (would not let humans pat him), his brother Friendly (aka D-Struction) loved being patted by people.  And both cats loved my doggie - Patty Cakes - and would run up and smooch and rub against him every time they saw him, so I there was no way that I could turn them away.

When I got other dogs - Sammi Trailer - they loved her as well.  And when any dogs came to visit - like my friends doggies or my mother's doggies, they loved them as well.

For the first few days, I fed the cats dog food because that is all I had in my house.  (Patty Cakes wont eat dog food - he insists on human food).  The next week, I purchased a lot of cat food (tins) but by then the cats preferred dog food and they have been eating this ever since: it's great for their coats !

D-Struction (aka Friendly Cat) spent a lot of time inside during the day, and learned how to use cat flaps quickly.

K-OS (aka Sneaky Cat) was very skittish inside the house, and it took him a lot longer to learn how to use cat flaps.  A year later and he was still struggling with *Cat Flap 101*.

Gradually, over time, Sneaky Cat (aka K-OS) became friendlier to me and would let me pat him.

BUT, both cats had to sleep in the enclosed veranda area, and not in the main house, because they just caused too much chaos and no-one got any sleep.  eg. knocking over all of my Larva Lamps and smashing them on the ground, climbing up fly screens and curtains and shredding them, eating my dinner as it cooks in a frying pan, disturbing poor old Sammi as she tries to sleep, violently jumping up walls to try and catch gecko lizards, and so on.  Whenever the cats were inside, CHAOS and DESTRUCTION ensued - hence their names K-OS and D-Struction.  Also, when they aren't causing destruction and chaos, they spent the night purring and smooching, disturbing everyone all night long, attacking my legs and toes as I twitch in my sleep, and no-one got any sleep at all.

Sadly, D-Struction (aka Friendly cat) disappeared in March-2023 approx while I was away for the day, and I have not seen him since.  Very sad.  I'm always keeping a lookout for him in nearby areas.

K-OS (aka Sneaky Cat) isn't called K-OS that for nothing - he causes absolute chaos.  And his brother "Friendly Cat" (aka D-Struction) isn't much better.  And when they get together with Patty Cakes, it's absolute and total chaos - but hilarious to watch.

During the day and part of the night I let the cats inside the main part of the house ... and the fun and games begin.  Ohhh boy !
