#  K-OS (aka Sneaky Cat) and D-Struction (aka Friendly Cat)

K-OS and his twin brother Friendly Cat turned up one day on my door step, starving hungry, and cold in mid-2022.  Someone had dumped them ?  Even though K-OS was very skittish (would not let humans pat him), Friendly Cat loved patted by people.  And both cats loved my doggie - Patty Cakes.  So, I adopted them and gave them a great home.

For the first few days, I fed the cats dog food because that is all I had in my house.  (Patty Cakes wont eat dog fod - he insists on human food).  The next week, I purchased a lot of cat food (tins) but by then the cats preferred dog food and they have been eating this ever since: great for their coats !

The cats mostly lives outside, because they cause so much havoc and destruction inside the house - climbing curtains, knocking over my larva lamp collection, eating my dinner as it cooks in a frying pan, disturbing poor old Sammi as she tries to sleep, violently jumping up walls to try and catch gecko lizards, and so on.  If I let the cats stay inside overnight, they spend the whole night purring and smooching, disturbing everyone all night long, playing, attacking my legs and toes and I twitch in my sleep, and no-one gets any sleep at all.   K-OS isn't called that for bothing - he causes absolute chaos.  And his brother "Friendly Cat" (aka D-Struction) isn't much better.  When they get together with Patty Cakes, it's absolute chaos.

But during the day and part of the night I let the cats inside ... and the fun and games begin.
